A required prefix to identify that this is a string in the standard connection format.
username:password@
Optional. Authentication credentials.

If specified, the client will attempt to authenticate the u
























ser to the 
authSource
. If 
authSource
 is unspecified, the client will attempt to authenticate the user to the defaultauthdb. And if the defaultauthdb is unspecified, to the admin database.

NOTE
If the username or password includes the following characters:

: / ? # [ ] @

those characters must be converted using 
percent encoding.

See also 
authSource.

host[:port]
The host (and optional port number) where the mongod instance (or mongos instance for a sharded cluster) is running. You can specify a hostname, IP address, or UNIX domain socket. Specify as many hosts as appropriate for your deployment topology:

For a standalone, specify the hostname of the standalone mongod instance.

For a replica set, specify the hostname(s) of the mongod instance(s) as listed in the replica set configuration.

For a sharded cluster, specify the hostname(s) of the mongos instance(s).

If the port number is not specified, the default port 27017 is used.

/defaultauthdb
Optional. The authentication database to use if the connection string includes username:password@ authentication credentials but the 
authSource
 option is unspecified.

If both 
authSource
 and defaultauthdb are unspecified, the client will attempt to authenticate the specified user to the admin database.

?<options>
Optional. A query string that specifies connection specific options as <name>=<value> pairs. See 
Connection String Options
 for a full description of these options.

If the connection string does not specify a database/ you must specify a slash (/) between the last host and the question mark (?) that begins the string of options.

DNS Seed List Connection Format
In addition to the standard connection format, MongoDB supports a DNS-constructed seed list. Using DNS to construct the available servers list allows more flexibility of deployment and the ability to change the servers in rotation without reconfiguring clients.

In order to leverage the DNS seed list, use a connection string prefix of mongodb+srv rather than the standard mongodb. The +srv indicates to the client that the hostname that follows corresponds to a DNS SRV record. The driver or 
mongosh
 will then query the DNS for the record to determine which hosts are running the mongod instances.A required prefix to identify that this is a string in the standard connection format.
username:password@
Optional. Authentication credentials.

If specified, the client will attempt to authenticate the user to the 
authSource
. If
